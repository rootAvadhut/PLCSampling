# PLC Interface Application

This application is a Python-based GUI for interacting with a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The application allows users to:
- Set the IP address and port number for the PLC.
- Configure the sampling frequency.
- Monitor data for changes and log these changes to an Excel file.

## Features
- **IP Address and Port Configuration:** Users can input the IP address and port number for the PLC connection.
- **Sampling Frequency:** The user can specify the sampling frequency, which can vary from 0.1 seconds to 1 minute.
- **Data Logging:** When there is a significant change in the sampled data, the application logs the data along with a timestamp to an Excel file.
